Steve Conner - Merged PR 230971: Revert 'Revert '780271 - Design review changes for account shipping''
spoke with @<LANCASTER\drkramer>  and @<LANCASTER\lta>  about this, it makes sense to get rid of the landing screen and go straight to the addresses since the links on the landing screen don't currently serve a purpose.

Also spoke with @<LANCASTER\lta> about adjusting the left padding on the back arrow in HeaderWithBackButton because it's used in multiple places, she confirmed that it should be further left (16 from the left)
